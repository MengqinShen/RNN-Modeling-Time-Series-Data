Modeling Time Series Data with Recurrent Neural Networks in Keras

A time series is a series of data points, ordered in time. For complex systems, each data point will likely be multivariate, meaning there are multiple variables for each data point. Examples of data sets with multivariate time series data are financial markets, air quality measurement, and health records.The goal of this project is to build an example deep neural network that can predict future outcomes based on time series, which in this case is patient information contained in patient records. 
At the end of the project,a deep neural network model has been built to predict patient mortality.
